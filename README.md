# Java Coding 90 Days Challenge

## About
A structured 90 day's journey to master Java programming through daily coding exercises, projects and problem solving. This repository is designed to build strong fundamentals, improve logical thinking and prepare for real-world development and interviews. Each day introduces new concepts with practical examples, ensuring consistent progress.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into daily folders (e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.), each containing:
- **Source Code**: Java files demonstrating the day's concepts.
- **Resources**: PDF guides or notes relevant to the topic.
- **Exercises**: Practice problems and solutions.

## Daily Progress

| Day   | Topic                          | Key Concepts                   | Status      |
| :--- | :---                           | :---                           | :---        |
| **Day 1** | Input Based Calculator    | Basic Syntax, Input/Output, Arithmetic Operations | ✅ Completed |
| **Day 2** | *Coming Soon*             | ...                            | ⏳ Pending  |
| ...   | ...                            | ...                            | ...         |

## How to Run the Code

1.  **Navigate to the Day's Directory**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change directory to the specific day you want to run.
    ```bash
    cd Day1
    ```

2.  **Compile the Java File**:
    Use the `javac` command to compile the source code.
    ```bash
    javac InputBasedCalculator.java
    ```

3.  **Run the Compiled Class**:
    Execute the program using the `java` command.
    ```bash
    java InputBasedCalculator
    ```

## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Java.
- Enhance problem-solving skills with daily practice.
- Prepare for technical interviews with common coding questions.
- Develop real-world projects.
